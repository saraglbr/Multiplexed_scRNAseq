# Multiplexed_scRNAseq

scRNA-seq timecoure during PGCLCs induction

The data consist of 6 samples all collected at different points during PGCLC induction in wild type cells:

-   EpiLCs, 5h, 16h, 32, 48h and Day 6.

All samples were collected and stain with CMO oligos. They were then pooled on a 1:1 ratio and processed together for microfluidics and library prep. After sequencing (of both the GEX and MP libraries, details bellow). Cell ranger multi was run on the fastqc files
